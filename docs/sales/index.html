<h2>ETGRA SALES RULES</h2>
<p>Animals can be checked-in Saturday from 7:30 am until noon. The animals must be in the check-in line by noon am on sale day to be included in the sale.</p>
<p>Animals are sifted for obvious health problems prior to sale. Knots, other than those caused by recent injections, will exclude an animal from sale.</p>
<p>Sellers can provide a signed breeder’s guarantee if selling goats as breeding stock. This is optional. Bucks and does can still be sold as breeding stock without a breeder’s guarantee.</p>
<p>In order for animal to sell as ‘registered’, the seller must present a certificate of registration listing the seller as the owner of the goat. The exception is a nursing kid, who may sell with an application signed by the seller (registered owner of the dam). Also a kid less than 6 months old may sell with an application. For kids being sold with application to register, the application must be completed, signed and accompanied by copy of any registered parents registration papers and a service memo for sire, if sire not owned by seller at the time of breeding. The dam of the kid must be registered in the seller’s name. A non-nursing kid must be tattooed.</p>
<p>At check-in, the tattoos and tags of registered animals are checked against the certificates of registration. Discrepancies will exclude the animal from the sale as a registered animal. Changes to certificates of registrations, or tattooing of the animal will not be done on the premise. THEREFORE, sellers are advised to check animals against the certificates of registration prior to loading animals to bring to the sale.</p>
<p>ALL paperwork to sell a registered animal must be completed prior to check-in. Please sign the certificates of registration, complete service memos on bred does, and complete applications for all kids.</p>
<p>There shall be no alleyway trading after the animal has been checked in. All Animals that have been checked in must go through the sales ring.</p>
<p>At an open sale the commission is $7 per head for ETGRA members and $11 per head for non-ETGRA members. The PO1 Fee is $7 per head for ETGRA members and $11 per head for non-ETGRA members. Once check-in is complete, the seller will pay either $ 7 or $ 11 per lot. Sellers may join the association the day of the sale and take advantage of the $ 7 per head commission or PO fee.</p>
<p>Seller may elect to sell a doe and nursing kids as one lot, paying one commission/ PO fee for the family. During the auction, seller may elect to split the family and pay one commission/ PO Fee per animal. These changes will be noted on the auction ticket.</p>
<p>ETGRA will mail a check to the sellers within one week of the sale. Sellers will not be paid the day of the sale.</p>
<p>ETGRA acts as an agent only. Soundness of the animal as well as accuracy of information contained on the registration paper, an application to register and service memo are the responsibility of the seller.</p>
<p>Sellers will sign a copy of the sales rules at the time of check-in. Copies of the sales rules will be made available to potential buyers on the day of the sale.</p>
<p>Although not a requirement, buyers appreciate information about worming (when and what kind), date of last hoof trimming, type of vaccinations within the last year, and date of last kidding, if applicable.</p>
<p>Seller’s signature ______________________ Date _________
Revised Sept 25, 2016</p>
<p>1 PO Fee is the same as commission. This is to clarify for sellers new to the business that if a seller is not pleased with the top bid and chooses to pass over the selling of an animal, the commission amount is still due for the privilege of putting the goat through the sale.</p>
