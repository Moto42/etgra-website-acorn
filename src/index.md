The ETGRA is a non-profit organization composed of goat enthusiasts with a desire to promote the goat industry in East Texas. The organization was established in 1996 by a group of farmers and ranchers who were interested in raising and marketing goats. 

The group sponsors events such as sales, shows, and presentations of interest to goat raisers. The organization is headed by a Board of Directors elected by the general membership. Quarterly membership meetings are held within the East Texas area.

Although the ETGRA primarily represents the East Texas area, we invite everyone with an interest in goats to join.
