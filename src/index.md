Welcome to East Texas Goat Raisers Association’s (ETGRA) web page. ETGRA was formed in 1996 by a dedicated group of Goat Ranchers and Farmers to promote the goat industry in East Texas. This dedication remains the priority of ETGRA’s Board and general membership. The association sponsors sales, shows, and workshops on a regular basis. Workshops cover all facets of raising goats such as marketing, feeding, medications, worming, genetics, preventative care, and general husbandry of goats. We invite all people in the goat industry to attend these events and hopefully join ETGRA. Whether you are a seasoned veteran or new to the practice of raising goats, ETGRA has a spot for you. There is a monthly meeting the first Tuesday of every month. Contact ETGRA or look under Events for meeting times, location, and method (most meetings are held via teleconference). There are quarterly meetings for the general membership. These are held at our property, located at 32186 U S Hwy 69 N, Jacksonville, TX 75766.
